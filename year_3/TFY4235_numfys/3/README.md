#Nuclear decay and photon scattering

Run with `python -m nuclear`

Run tests with `pytest`

Run qualitative tests with `python -m tests.qualitative`

Requires numpy. Tests requires matplotlib and pytest. There are probably more requirements by the time I'm done. I don't feel like making a `requirements.txt`
