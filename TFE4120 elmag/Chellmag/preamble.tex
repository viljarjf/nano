\noindent This document contains some of the formulas and results from the course, with some motivation where I felt like it. 
This is not intended as learning material, bur rather as a collection of formulas with the required assumptions specified. 
Error reporting to \textit{viljar@timini.no} is much appreciated. 
A vector quantity without an arrow is the modulus of the corresponding vector, if not otherwise specified. 
I might also have changed the vector notation from arrows to bold letters, without changing this disclaimer. 
Vectors with hats are unit vectors.
The lectures and my notes are both in english, and as such this document will also be in english.
