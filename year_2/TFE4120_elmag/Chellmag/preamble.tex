\noindent This document contains some of the formulas and results from the course, with some motivation where I felt like it. 
This is not intended as learning material, but rather as a collection of formulas with the required assumptions specified. 
At least, that was originally the intention, but over time it turned more into a summary of lecture notes.
Error reporting to \textit{viljar@timini.no} is much appreciated. 
Vectors are written in bold lettering.
A vector quantity without bold lettering is the modulus of the corresponding vector, if not otherwise specified. 
Vectors with hats are unit vectors.
The lectures and my notes are both in english, and as such this document will also be in english.
