\begin{abstract}
Semiconductor processing and manufacturing is becoming increasingly important for modern technology, both as electronic processing units and as other micro- and nano-scale components. Two \ce{GaAs} chips, labeled chip 218 and chip 219, were manufactured using molecular beam epitaxy, and a Hall bar was created using photolithography. The characterisation indicates that chip 218 was $n$-doped, and 219 was $p$-doped. The carrier density of chip 218 was found to be \SI{5.5(0.0)e17}{\per\centi\metre\cubed}, and \SI{1.3(0.0)e18}{\per\centi\metre\cubed} for chip 219.
For chip 218, the Hall mobility was found to be \SI{3.3(1)e3}{\centi\metre\squared\per\volt\per\second}, whereas for chip 219 it was found to be \SI{1.8(0)e2}{\centi\metre\squared\per\volt\per\second}.
